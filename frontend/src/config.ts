 *                    adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000
 *                  Works on a physical phone and on an emulator. Involves no wifi
 *                  at all, which is exactly why it is also the demo-day transport.
 *                  ★ Re-run the command every time you replug the phone. If you
 *                    forget, requests hang in a way indistinguishable from the
 *                    server being down.
 *
 *   'emulator'     10.0.2.2:8000 — the Android emulator's built-in alias for the
 *                  host machine. Zero setup, emulator only. Note `localhost`
 *                  inside an emulator IS the emulator; that confusion is the most
 *                  common first-day React Native mistake.
 *
 *   'lan'          LAN_IP:8000, phone and laptop on the same wifi. Last resort.
 *                  Venue wifi fails. It always fails.
