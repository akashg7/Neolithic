/**
 * Tab bar icons. Hand-rolled `react-native-svg`. Pranay.
 *
 * ★ Why this file exists at all: React Navigation does not render a text-only
 *   tab bar when you omit `tabBarIcon`. `bottom-tabs/BottomTabBar.js` substitutes
 *   its own `MissingIcon`, which renders the single codepoint U+23F7 (⏷) — and
 *   that codepoint has no glyph in the stock Android font, so it comes out as a
 *   tofu box ▯. Twelve tabs, twelve ▯. It is React Navigation's deliberate
 *   "you forgot your icons" marker and it reads, correctly, as unfinished.
 *
 * ★ Why not an icon library: `12_STACK.md` §2 bans `react-native-vector-icons`
 *   (a font asset per platform plus a native link step, for twelve glyphs).
 *   `react-native-svg` is already a dependency for the charts, so twelve paths
 *   in one file costs nothing new and nothing can fail to link.
 *
 * ★ Why outline, not filled: the icons carry no meaning a farmer relies on — the
 *   Marathi label below does. These exist so the bar reads as a finished product
 *   and so the shape gives a second, non-reading cue to which tab you are on.
 *   An outline at `strokeWidth` 1.9/2.6 thickens visibly when focused, which is
 *   the cheapest possible active state on a cheap screen in sunlight.
 *
 * Every path is drawn in a 24×24 box and scaled by the `size` React Navigation
 * hands us, so it tracks the platform's own icon sizing (25 round / 24 material).
