/**
 * CANON-shaped fixtures for the hero endpoint.
 *
 * These exist so the app can be built, run and demoed before `POST /ai/window/recommend`
 * exists. Nobody waits for a person; you wait for a contract, and the contract is
 * `docs/architecture/00_CANON.md` §7.4.
 *
 * ★ Every value here is transcribed from CANON. **If a key is not in CANON §7.4, it
 *   does not go in this file.** Six invented fields were caught before H0 — a screen
 *   built on an invented fixture renders perfectly in every rehearsal and breaks the
 *   first time it touches the real endpoint.
 *
 * The arithmetic identities are asserted in `__tests__/window.test.ts`, because a
 * 100× unit error is the likeliest bug in the entire project and a comment does not
 * catch it.
