/**
 * voice.ts — Marathi offline voice engine.
 * Decomposes rupees and days into sequenced audio clips, then plays them back
 * with `react-native-sound`. Works 100% offline (I7) — every clip is a local
 * file, never a network fetch, so airplane mode is the expected path, not an
 * edge case.
 *
 * ★ CANON/12_STACK.md §"Voice" names `react-native-sound` as the sanctioned
 *   library for exactly this (pre-generated clips, sequenced), with
 *   `react-native-tts` documented as the *fallback* — not `expo-av`, since
 *   this is React Native CLI with no Expo runtime at all.
 *
 * ★ THE PRE-GENERATED CLIP CONTENT IS NOT SHIPPED IN THIS COMMIT. Generating
 *   ~123 real Marathi speech mp3s (one per id, per `assets/audio/mr/README.md`)
 *   is a TTS content pass over real audio, which nothing in a coding session
 *   can produce — so `react-native-tts` is not the fallback-of-last-resort
 *   here, it is doing the actual work: `speak()` tries the pre-generated clip
 *   first (silent today, since none exist) and falls back to the device's
 *   on-device TTS engine speaking the same Marathi text live. This is what
 *   keeps beat 7 ("voice, then airplane mode") non-silent without the mp3s —
 *   `react-native-tts` needs no network either, it speaks through whatever
 *   TTS engine and voice data are already installed on the phone.

 *       const done = e => { if (e.utteranceId !== utteranceId) return; ... }
 *       utteranceId = Tts.speak(text);
 *
 *   `react-native-tts`'s TypeScript declaration says `speak()` returns
 *   `string | number`. It does not. The Android native method is
 *   `speak(String utterance, ReadableMap params, Promise promise)` — a
 *   `Promise` parameter — so the bridge hands JavaScript back a **Promise**,
 *   and `utteranceId` was a Promise object. `e.utteranceId !== utteranceId`
 *   was therefore true for every event ever fired, `done` never resolved,
 *   and this function returned a promise that never settled.
 *
 *   Every caller `await`s it inside a `try/finally` that flips a `speaking`
 *   flag back off. The `finally` never ran. So the listen button changed to
 *   the muted-speaker icon when tapped and stayed that way for the life of
 *   the screen, on every screen, and the narration could not be replayed
 *   because the button was already showing its "stop" state. The
 *   `.d.ts` being wrong is why this compiled and why it survived review.
 *
 * ★ The id is now awaited before it is compared, completions that arrive
 *   before the id is known are honoured rather than dropped, and a guard
 *   timer settles the promise if the engine never reports at all. The UI
 *   flag can no longer be left stuck on by anything the engine does.
