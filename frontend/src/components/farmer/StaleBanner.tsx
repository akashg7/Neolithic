/**
 * StaleBanner — P11. Renders nothing when the data on screen is fresh;
 * renders its age in Marathi, with the actual clock time, when it is not.
 *
 * ★ Age is the only signal, on purpose — no NetInfo, no connectivity check.
 *   `offline.ts`'s cache has no way to know whether the network is actually
 *   down; it only knows how old what is currently rendered is. That is also
 *   the more honest thing to tell a farmer: "this is from 11:40" is true
 *   whether the phone is offline or the server was just slow.
 *
 * ★ Additive only. Every screen that uses this still renders its own
 *   loading/empty/error states first — this only ever appears inside the
 *   "data" branch, next to data that is actually on screen.
 *
 * ★ BUG FIXED: staleness is a function of wall-clock time, but the first draft
 *   read `Date.now()` during render with nothing to schedule a re-render. React
 *   does not re-render because a clock moved, so a screen left open — which is
 *   *exactly* the airplane-mode demo beat — kept showing no banner indefinitely,
 *   until some unrelated state change happened to repaint it. The banner would
 *   have looked correct in every test that mounts with already-old data, and
 *   silently absent on the one path that matters. Hence the ticker below.
